1. I used python3.6 for running this program beware that later or earlier versions of python may break script.
2. Install libraries first: pip install requests BeautifulSoup4 (Mac os). (use pip3 if planning to use python3)
3. Type "python3 get_posts.py" within bash terminal to run script.
4. Output file will be in current directory.
